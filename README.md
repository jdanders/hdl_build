# Introduction

The build system is built on GNU Makefile with helper scripts that provide the following functionality:

* Perform dependency analysis that enables discovery and compilation of dependent files from a top level file
* Generate simulation scripts, synthesis projects, as well as QSYS systems and megafunction IP cores
* Execute simulation and synthesis target programs after completing all preparatory steps.

Run `make help` for a list of targets, and `make helpall` for descriptions.

To get started

* clone or copy the hdl_build repository
* to choose a global default tool, create `default_sim.mk` or `default_synth.mk`, or locally set `SIM_TOOL` and/or `SYNTH_TOOL` in your makefile
    * See `example-default_sim.mk` and `example-default_synth.mk` for templates
* copy the `example.mk` file to your project build directory and rename it to `Makefile`
    * `example.mk` has the minimum for both sim and synth targets, with a QSF_EXTRA setting that will allow synthesis without worrying about pin assignments.
    * See `example-full-sim.mk` and `example-full-synth.mk` for examples of more options
* edit `Makefile` to have the correct simulation top module name as `TOP_SIM` and/or correct synthesis top module name as `TOP_SYNTH`
* run `make sim` or `make synth`
    * synthesis projects require setting `FAMILY` and `DEVICE`

See the full makefile examples for adding other features to your project Makefile.

# Software Requirements

This build system depends on Intel Quartus and Siemens Questa or Modelsim for synthesis and simulation. Other tools could be added.

The `vsim` command needs to be in the path for simulation, and the default `modelsim.ini` file will be copied from the detected install path.

Quartus synthesis requires two variables in the use Makefile to create a project:

* `FAMILY`, for example `FAMILY := "Arria 10"`
* `DEVICE`, for example `DEVICE := 10AS123N2F40I2SG`


Quartus install path must have the string "pro" in it if using Quartus Pro, and must not have "pro" in it if using Quartus Standard. The default path name of `intelFPGA_pro` meets this requirement.

Python 3.6 or higher is required, with the PyYAML yaml package installed for substitution files. If Python 3.6 is not available, replace all the 'f' strings with .format strings.

The build system is designed to run within a git repository. To work outside of a repo see section "Outside of git".

## Extending hdl_build

To add new makefiles that are not upstreamed, create `*_addon.mk` or `*_custom.mk` makefiles in the base directory. These files will be included by `build.mk`, but keeping them as separate files reduces merge/rebase conflicts. The `_custom.mk` suffix is ignored by git and is intended to be used for files you do not want committed at all.

# Verilog Coding Requirements and Naming Conventions

Module, package, and include dependencies are automatically determined.

* Modules can only be implemented in files with any of the following extensions: `.v`, `.sv`, `.ip`, `.qsys`, `_qmw.v` (megawizard)
* The module name must be the same as the "base" of the filename. For example, module `bypass_fifo` could be implemented as `bypass_fifo.sv` or `bypass_fifo.qsys`.
    * Megafunction IP cores should be saved using the `_qmw.v` suffix. This is the only exception where the filename can be different than the module name. For example, a PLL called `clkgen` should be stored as `clkgen_qmw.v` (this is the file that has the megawizard settings embedded as comments). The module name in the code should still be `clkgen` without the `_qmw` extension. The build system will automatically handle building the megafunction for synthesis.
* Only a single module definition is allowed per file.
* Header files included by preprocessor ``` `include``` must end in `.svh` or `.vh` extension.
* In cases where a module needs to be replaced with a sim-only or synth-only module, use `SIM_SUBSTITUTIONS` or `SYNTH_SUBSTITUTIONS`. Modules used as substitutions do not need follow any naming conventions because they will be found by direct path rather than the built-in search capability.

# Usage

## Including build system

The build system can be included in a local Makefile with the following include line in the makefile:

```make
include /path/to/hdl_build/build.mk
```

* As a general guide:
    * variables used under `build.mk` need to be set before the include.
    * hooks are rules defined under `build.mk` need to be tied into after the include.
* The tool chain needs an entry point defined, such as `TOP_SIM` for simulation and `TOP_SYNTH` for synthesis.

## Build structure

### build.mk

The **`build.mk`** file provides the entry point and the basic structure for the build system. Use `make help` for an up-to-date list of targets provided.

* **`SLOW`**: Set SLOW=1 for a call to make to disable parallel building
* **`GIT_REPO`**: defined if in git repository (test if git repo with make's `ifdef`)
* **`SRC_BASE_DIR`**: directory that holds all relevant source code. Will be determined automatically if in a git repository.
* **`IGNORE_FILE`**: `touch .ignore_build_system` in a directory that should be ignored by the build system
* **`BLD_DIR`**: directory where build results are stored
* **`$(predependency_hook)`**: target hook to run something before dependency analysis
* **`IGNORE_DIRS`**: a list of space delineated directory names to ignore during dependency search
* **`EXTRA_DIRS`**: a list of space delineated directory names to add during dependency search. This is only useful for directories normally ignored by the build system or a directory outside the SRC_BASE_DIR directory.
* **`clean`**: target to force redo of build steps and remove previous logs
* **`cleanall`**: target to remove all build results
* **`nuke`**: target to alias for cleanall
* **`list_targets`**: target to list all available Makefile targets
* **`print-%`**: target to use 'make print-VARIABLE_NAME' to examine VARIABLE_NAME's values
    * `make print-BLD_DIR` for example

### modelsim.mk or questa.mk

The **`modelsim.mk`** or **`questa.mk`** file provides simulator related targets and consumes the dependency analysis results of **`build.mk`**.

# Outside of git

If you want to use this outside of a git repository, you will need to set the source path in your Makefile like this:

```make
SRC_BASE_DIR := /path/to/current/src_base_dir
TOP_SIM = test_mod

include $(BUILD_PATH)/build.mk
```

If you are in a git repository, the `SRC_BASE_DIR` defaults to the root of the repository.
